##Learning graphical models using junction trees

In this project we consider a paper by Vats and Nowak describing a framework for undirected graphical model selection (UGMS). This framework utilizes junction trees as a method to decompose the UGMS problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved efficiently using different UGMS algorithms. We evaluated this method by comparing the results of applying this method to a UGMS problem to applying a standalone UGMS algorithm directly. We tested all of these algorithms on both real and synthetic data. We find that while the junction tree algorithm provides significant gains in some cases, in others these gains are minimal and are offset by much higher computational costs.
